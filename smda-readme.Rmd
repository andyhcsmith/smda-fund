This project is an RShiny Web Application I built in order to track the performance of an Investing Syndicate that I have with some friends. Every month we contribute $20 each and pitch a company/commodity/option, and at the end we vote on our favourite pitch and invest the money into the highest vote. 

There were to main reasons I built this app:

* Track the performance of the syndicate (and create some healthy competition)
* Learn how to build a professional looking application through HTMLTemplates

The app is viewable [here](https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava)
