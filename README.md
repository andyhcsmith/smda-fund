Shiny App for Investing Syndicate
=================================

This project is an RShiny Web Application I built in order to track the
performance of an Investing Syndicate that I have with some friends.
Every month we contribute $20 each and pitch a company/commodity/option,
and at the end we vote on our favourite pitch and invest the money into
the highest vote. There were to main reasons I built this app:

-   Track the performance of the syndicate (and create some healthy
    competition)
-   Learn how to build a professional looking application through
    HTMLTemplates

The app is viewable [here](https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava)
