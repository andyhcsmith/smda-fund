This project is an RShiny Web Application I built in order to track the performance of an Investing Syndicate that I have with some friends. Every month we contribute $20 each and pitch a company/commodity/option, and at the end we vote on our favourite pitch and invest the money into the highest vote. 

There were to main reasons I built this app:

* Track the performance of the syndicate (and create some healthy competition)
* Learn how to build a professional looking application through HTMLTemplates

The app is viewable [here](https://andyhcsmith.shinyapps.io/smda/)

## Data Collection

There are two main sources of data that feeds the application:

* A Google Sheet that contains our monthly picks including information on who made the pick, the ticker symbol, the date the pick was made and whether or not the pick was chosen by the group. This gets manually updated after our monthly meeting. I use the `googlesheets4` package to retreive this when the app is run.

* Yahoo Finance to retrieve historical data on our picks. This is accessed by calls from R using the `getSymbols` function from the `quantmod` library.

## Technical Information

This web application was written using the R Shiny web framework/R package. It is a great demonstration on how `HTMLTemplates` can be used to create professional looking applications using R Shiny. The theme used was [Glint](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/glint/)

The visualisations (charts) used in this application are from `echarts4r`, which provide more professional looking graphs than ggplot.

## To-Do List

* Fix issues 
* Allow user to select 'change from date selected' vs 'absolute change' in plots
* Clean up 'Name and Shame' table
* Fix bug relating to multiple of same pick by same user
